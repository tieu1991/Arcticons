        <item>ðŸŒˆ I want to start this release note with wishing everyone a happy pride month!</item>
        <item>ðŸŽ‰ <b>414</b> new and updated icons!</item>
        <item>ðŸŸ¦ You may notice that square icons have been rounded some more. Over the past month, I have reworked 1400+ icons to make them feel a bit more modern.</item>
        <item>ðŸ”¥ 9649 icons in total!</item>
        <item>ðŸ™‚ Some of you may have noticed the lack of updates. Please keep in mind that I and other contributors are doing this in our free time. That makes it hard to maintain Arcticons with a full-time job. We\'re doing our best to keep it up to date!</item>
